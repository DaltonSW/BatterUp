## Footnotes

[^1]: This project is essentially a fork, but it felt strange to fork a repo and then just delete everything from it as the first step. I am a JavaScript Disliker, so contributing back also didn't make much sense. Rewriting/migrating it to Go sounded like a fun project, so here we are.
